<h1>The Start</h1>
OpenHashDatabase (or OHD for short) is a project build for the purpose of beeing the Wikipedia of Hashes.<br />
the project started as a small for fun database with MD5 hashes, but soon grew to a serious project.<br />
After taking the project down in September 2015, I got bored again.<br />
I still had the version of OHD laying that I was working with, so I continued working on it, and after alot of failures and errors, I finally got it working.<br />
After putting it back online, I realized that the layout was just bad, so I gathered the Bootstrap framework, and build a decent layout for OHD.<br />

<h1>OHD Now</h1>
OHD is growing a littlebit everyday, although I run into a small issue where my current webhost is not fast enough.
OHD won stop though, I will try to do my best to keep it running for as long as I can.
